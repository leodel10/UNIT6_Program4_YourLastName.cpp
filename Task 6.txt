Summary:

Over all comparing the averages of bubble sort and buil-in sort, built-n sort was overall faster. For example, the average time of the program bubble sort ascending was 0.01939467 seconds and built-in sort ascending was 0.001373 seconds. In the descending code of bubble sort was 0.018589667 seconds and using built-in sort, the average time was 0.00204967 seconds. Using a larger set or arrays, I believe using built-in sort will be more useful in time.
